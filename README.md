## Bind click to key

This is an app that will bind cursor clicks at specified coordinates to a keyboard key.

This is useful if you are extensively using an android emulator on Linux (like genymotion) that doesn't expose by itself a way of mapping the on screen touch buttons (like in games) to keyboard keys.

This provides an alternative way of making it work although it has it's obvious shortcomings which is the fact that there is only one cursor but there may be multiple buttons on screen that need to be simultaneusly pressed, in such a case this tool wont help much.

For convenience this program produces a file named `key_bindings.json` before it exits, which it will use to remember your previous key bindings.
